Logbook is inspired by Datadog, Altyrex, and Crack n Pack.

It distills detailed transaction events into historical and current summaries.

Summaries can rollup to granular accounts, account groups, or both.

In this journal are some things that didn't fit the todo format.

Logbook's summary could be a 2d grid composed of account and date.

The collapse of date has always been implicit in previous versions of logbook.

I expect early specification for daily columns informs superior design.
